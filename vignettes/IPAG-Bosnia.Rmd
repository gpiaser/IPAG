# Introduction

The IPAG package provides a collection of simple and pedagogical tools for
statistical inference in R.
It focuses on confidence intervals and concise regression summaries, with
clear defaults and readable outputs.

This vignette illustrates the main functionalities of IPAG using the
Bosnia dataset, which contains data from a microcredit program implemented
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and is commonly used for impact evaluation exercises.


```r
library(IPAG)
```

#The Bosnia dataset

We begin by loading the dataset.

```r
data(Bosnia)
```
The dataset contains individual-level observations related to participation
in a microcredit program and various economic outcomes.

For illustration, we focus on a continuous outcome variable (for example,
household income or expenditure) and a treatment indicator related to access
to microcredit.


## Confidence interval for a mean

Suppose we want to estimate the average value of a continuous outcome variable
(for example income) in the sample. By default, `mean_ci() computes a 99% confidence interval for the population
mean using a Student t test. 

```r
mean_ci(Bosnia$income)
```

The confidence level can be modified if needed.

```r
mean_ci(Bosnia$income, level = 0.95)
```

## Difference in means

A common question in impact evaluation is whether treated and untreated
individuals differ on average.

Assume `treatment is a binary variable indicating access to microcredit.Difference in means

```r
mean_diff_ci(
Bosnia$income[Bosnia$treatment == 1],
Bosnia$income[Bosnia$treatment == 0]
)
```

This computes a confidence interval for the difference in mean outcomes between
treated and control groups.

## Linear regression analysis

We now estimate a simple linear regression model to study the association
between microcredit access and the outcome variable, controlling for
covariates.


``r
linear_regress(
income ~ treatment + age + education,
data = Bosnia
)
```

The output reports:
- the adjusted R-squared,
- the p-value of the overall Fisher test,
- estimated coefficients with 99% confidence intervals,
- significance indicators for individual parameters.
This concise summary is designed to be easily interpretable in teaching
contexts.

# Interpretation

The tools provided by IPAG allow users to:
- emphasize uncertainty through confidence intervals,
- rely on standard statistical methods,
- produce readable outputs suitable for classroom demonstrations.
While the package does not aim to replace comprehensive statistical software,
it provides a lightweight and transparent interface for applied inference.

# Conclusion

This vignette has illustrated the core functionalities of IPAG using the
Bosnia dataset.
The package is particularly suited for instructional settings and applied
work in economics and social sciences where clarity and interpretability are
prioritized."
